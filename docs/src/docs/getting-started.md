## Installation

Simply install the library with NPM in order to add it to your dependencies

```bash
npm i athenic-ui
```

## Usage

Once you have installed Athenic UI you can start importing Components to your [React](https://reactjs.org/) project.

```js
// Import single components
import { Button } from "athenic-ui";

// Import everything
import * as Athenic from "athenic-ui";
```

## TypeScript

Not to forget, Athenic UI has built in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) declarations. So you can use all the components in your React TypeScript project as well.
